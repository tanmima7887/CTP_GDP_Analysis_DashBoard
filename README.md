# GDP Prediction and Visualization Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) based on various world statistics and to visualize the results. The project is currently in its initial stages, but further functionalities and improvements are planned.

## Data
The data used in this project consists of statistics from multiple countries across several years. Each row in the dataset represents a country and a specific year, while each column corresponds to a statistic such as population, surface area, and, of course, GDP.

### Data Structure
The dataset has been restructured to have the following columns:
- `country_name`: The name of the country
- `country_code`: The code representing the country
- `year`: The year of the data
- `population`: Population of the country for that year
- `surface_area`: Surface area of the country
- `...`: Various other statistics
- `gdp`: Gross Domestic Product

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and some data manipulation and machine learning libraries installed. The primary libraries used are Pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the data transformation script to obtain the restructured dataset (if not already provided).
4. Execute the machine learning script to train the model and make predictions.
5. Use the visualization script to see the results.

## Future Work
- Implement feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
- Use more advanced machine learning models.
- Create interactive visualizations.
- Extend the project to predict other key performance indicators (KPIs) besides GDP.
